The scanning was performed at different libraries in Sweden (Royal Library in Stockholm, and University Libraries in Gothenburg, Lund & Uppsala). The work of producing the e-texts in The Swedish Literature Bank was a collective effort of Cai Alfredson and other editors at The Swedish Literature Bank, The Swedish Society for Belles-Lettres, The Collected Works of August Strindberg and The Society of Swedish Literature in Finland.
